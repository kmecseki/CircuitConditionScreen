# Circuit Condition Screen

This mod adds two types of lamps that show the status of a circuit network condition connected to it.

**Circuit lamp**: Monitors a circuit conditions and changes colors based on it. The colors can be customized in the mod settings menu.
**Circuit alarm**: Monitors the circuit conditions. Shows red and sounds an alarm if the set condition is true, green light and no audible alarm otherwise.

Performance improvements are added for megabases.
Works together with the major overhaul mods (SE, Py etc.).
